STORY: 
There is a spear throw competition. Two people(red and green) are competing for winning trophy.
Red person succeeded at hitting the target. However, green person failed to hit the target.
Therefore, red person wins the trophy and he seems happy!

1. I used high-level hierarchiacal object while creating person1, person2, trophy, table, and spear, the weapon.

2. I used the camera tracking a moving object using lookAt() when person1 and person2 throw their spears in order to hit the target.

3. I designed my own polygonal objects: octahedron and star.

4. Octahedron is flat-shaded and star is smooth-shaded.

5. It means that octahedron doesn't share vertices while star does share vertices.

6. I push all normals by using "recipient.flat_normals_from_triples(index_offset);" at the end.

7. When decorating the backgrown and color objects, I texture them (including my own polygonal objects) by mapping an image.

8. I made my animation runs at the same speed regardless of the machine my program runs on.

9. My animation's length is 90 seconds. I record it by using QuickTime. (It is within 100MB)
